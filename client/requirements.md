## Packages
framer-motion | Essential for complex wave animations and smooth page transitions
lucide-react | Beautiful icons for the player controls (already in base but ensuring version)

## Notes
Audio Engine will use the native Web Audio API (AudioContext) directly - no external library needed for purity.
Visualizer will use HTML5 Canvas API.
Dark mode is default for this sleep-focused app.
