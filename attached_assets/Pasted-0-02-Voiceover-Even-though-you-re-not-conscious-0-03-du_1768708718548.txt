Voiceover: Even though you're not conscious
0:03
during sleep,
0:04
your brain is deceptively active.
0:06
It goes through multiple cycles
0:08
with distinct brain patterns,
0:09
and it's very important to your ability
0:11
to perform normal functions when you're awake.
0:14
You have four main stages of sleep
0:16
which occur in approximately 90 minute cycles
0:19
during a normal night of sleep.
0:21
The first three stages are all considered
0:24
non-rapid eye movement,
0:26
or non-REM which I'm going to abbreviate
0:28
as N1, N2, and N3.
0:34
N1 is the stage between sleep and wakefulness.
0:39
This is when your brain starts producing theta waves.
0:45
You might experience strange sensations
0:47
known as hypnagogic hallucinations,
0:50
just kind of a fun name.
0:52
These can include hearing or seeing things
0:56
that aren't there such as seeing
0:58
a flash of light,
0:59
or a lot of people hear someone calling their name,
1:01
or a phone ring, or a doorbell,
1:02
or something like that.
1:05
Or if you've been doing something
1:06
really repetitive just before bed,
1:09
then that can recur in your hypnagogic state.
1:12
For example, if you've been on a boat all day,
1:14
you may still feel like you're on water
1:16
when you drift off to sleep
1:18
even if you're on dry land.
1:20
Or something that's actually called
1:21
the Tretis effect,
1:22
if you've been playing Tetris
1:24
for a long time right before bed,
1:25
then you might experience visual images
1:28
of blocks or something all moving
1:30
in the same direction kind of like
1:31
the blocks in the game.
1:33
Another common feeling during this stage
1:36
is a feeling of falling.
1:38
That leads to what's called hypnic jerks,
1:40
or those muscle twitches you sometimes experience
1:43
as you fall asleep.
1:46
So that's N1, our first, lightest stage of sleep.
1:50
Then we move into N2 which is
1:53
a slightly deeper stage of sleep.
1:56
Although it's still pretty easy
1:57
to wake up someone in N1,
1:59
people in N2 are harder to awaken.
2:02
We see more theta waves
2:05
as well as something called sleep spindles
2:07
and K-complexes.
2:10
Sleep spindles are these bursts
2:11
of rapid rhythmic brain activity.
2:14
There's a lot we don't know
2:16
about the purpose of each sleep stage
2:18
and the function of these brain waves,
2:20
but some researchers think that sleep spindles
2:23
help inhibit certain cognitive processes
2:25
or perceptions so that we maintain
2:28
a tranquil state during sleep.
2:30
For example, sleep spindles in some
2:33
parts of the brain are associated
2:34
with people's ability to sleep through loud noises.
2:40
K-complexes are kind of similar,
2:43
but they're a different type of brain activity
2:45
that's also thought to suppress cortical arousal
2:47
and keep you asleep basically.
2:50
They're also thought to help
2:51
with sleep-based memory consolidation
2:53
which is the theory that some memories
2:55
are transferred into your long-term memory
2:57
during sleep.
2:59
What's cool is that even though K-complexes
3:02
do occur naturally,
3:04
you can also make them occur
3:05
by gently touching someone who's in
3:07
this stage of sleep like just brushing
3:09
against their skin and that will induce
3:12
some K-complex activity.
3:15
What your brain does is sort of assess
3:19
that the touch on the skin is non-threatening,
3:23
and it suppresses the processing of that stimuli
3:26
to help keep you asleep.
3:32
Beyond N2 we have N3.
3:34
This is our last non-REM stage.
3:36
N3 is also called slow-wave sleep
3:40
because as you might guess brain waves
3:42
are very slow.
3:43
These are called delta waves.
3:45
They have a range of about point five to two hertz.
3:50
You get basically a half to two oscillations
3:53
of these brain waves per second.
3:58
When you're in N3 sleep,
3:59
you are very much dead to the world,
4:02
and really difficult to wake up.
4:04
If you walk or talk in your sleep,
4:06
this is the stage where those things happen.
4:11
The last stage we need to talk about
4:13
is REM sleep.
4:14
REM is R-E-M, stands for rapid-eye movement.
4:17
That's because this stage
4:19
is when your eyes move really rapidly
4:21
beneath your lids.
4:24
Also, most of your other muscles are paralyzed.
4:27
This paralysis might actually be
4:29
a good thing because most dreaming occurs
4:31
during REM sleep.
4:32
If you weren't paralyzed your muscles might
4:34
act out whatever you were dreaming about
4:36
which could be unsafe for you
4:37
and anyone sleeping near you
4:40
depending on what type of dreams you have.
4:43
REM sleep is sometimes called paradoxical sleep
4:46
because your brain actually seems very active
4:48
and awake, but your body is prevented
4:50
from doing anything.
4:52
It's kind of crazy.
4:54
Now in a normal night of uninterrupted sleep,
4:57
you cycle through these stages
4:58
about four or five times each.
5:00
It takes about 90 minutes to go through
5:02
a complete cycle,
5:04
but the order, it doesn't just go
5:06
one, two, three, REM.
5:08
The order within a cycle tends to go
5:10
from N1 to N2 to N3 and then back to N2
5:18
before entering REM sleep,
5:20
and then back to N1,
5:21
and then it starts all over again.
5:24
How long each stage lasts depends
5:26
partially on how old you are,
5:28
and partially on how long you've been asleep.
5:30
You tend to do a lot more slow-wave sleep,
5:33
or N3 sleep in the first few hours,
5:36
and then more REM sleep right before you wake up.
5:39
That's why if you really want to try
5:41
to remember your dreams,
5:42
you can set your alarm to go off
5:43
a little earlier than usual like 15 minutes
5:46
so you'll get jerked out of REM sleep
5:49
and are more likely to remember what you dreamed.
5:52
You know that you get tired probably around
5:54
the same time every afternoon or evening,
5:57
and you might wonder how your body
5:59
knows when to fall asleep,
6:01
or why a lot of people get tired in the afternoon.
6:06
The answer lies in something called
6:08
our circadian rhythms.
6:11
Just like our sleep has cyclical stages,
6:14
so does our wakefulness,
6:15
and our transition for wakefulness to sleeping.
6:18
Circadian rhythms are our regular bodily rhythms
6:21
across a 24-hour period which is also called
6:24
our internal biological clock.
6:26
These cycles control our body temperature
6:30
which rises during the day,
6:31
and then takes a brief dip
6:33
in the early afternoon,
6:35
and then goes up again in the evening,
6:36
and then falls during the nighttime.
6:40
So it can control our body temperature,
6:41
and our sleep cycle, all sorts of things.
6:45
Daylight is a big queue for circadian rhythms,
6:47
and even artificial light can affect
6:49
your circadian clock.
6:51
That's why when you travel somewhere
6:52
with a big time difference,
6:53
airplanes will usually adjust the lights
6:55
in accordance with the time zone
6:57
of your destination.
6:58
They're trying to help you reset
6:59
your biological clock,
7:01
but resetting that clock can take time
7:03
which is when you experience jet lag.
7:05
Your biological clock says it's time
7:07
to go to sleep,
7:08
but your new time zone says it's time to wake up.
7:11
That transition can be a little taxing
7:14
if you're traveling.
7:17
These circadian rhythms also change as you age
7:19
which is why a lot of younger people
7:21
tend to be night owls,
7:23
but as they age older people
7:25
tend to wake up and go to bed early.
7:30
Your circadian rhythms can also
7:31
prevent you from sleeping in
7:33
when you want to sometimes.
7:34
So maybe you get up every day at six AM
7:37
Monday through Friday,
7:39
and then Saturday you can finally sleep in,
7:41
but you'll still wake up around six AM.
7:44
That's because your internal biological clock
7:47
has adjusted to you waking up at that time
7:49
so it regulates your metabolism,
7:51
body temperature, sleep cycles
7:53
so that you wake up at the same time.
